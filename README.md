 # Simple Program to store streamed Tweets in a MongoDB

 To specify the hashtag filter, the list `HASHTAG_LIST` in hashtags.py has to be edited and has to include the relevant hashtags. 

 ## Env File

 To access the Twitter API, there has to be a file called `.env` in this folder.

 This file has to include the Tokens to access the API:

```
    TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN = <your access token>
    TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRETm = <your access token secret>
    TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY = <your consumer key>
    TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET = <your consumer secret>
```
